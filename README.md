Nixos_music_production_environment
 Trying Nixo to work with audio
## First test envirenment in xfce
 - cant configure lightdm in the way that ai like
 - unetbootin dont work properly
 - system tray icons are flickering
 - no flakes
 - Pipewire configurations work very well
 - Configuration for canon rebel t2i as web cam work very well too.
 
I will stop these configs for now, just backup the littlo work that i've already done to come back to this in 2023.
